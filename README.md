# Crash Course Godot 3

This folder (besides the assets folder) contains every file one would get if they made a project from scratch.  Some things has been modified for the purpose of making the lesson quicker to teach.

The assets folder contains assets (including scenes) to be used during the lesson.  These are NOT available from Godot 3 by default.
